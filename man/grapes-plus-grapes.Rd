\description{
Many programming languages utilize \code{+} as a means of
concatenating strings. In standard R, however, \code{+} will
return an error when used with strings. \verb{\%+\%} ports this
capability over. By default, it uses \code{paste0} under the
hood, but this can be shifted to \code{paste} by running
\code{options(infixit.paste = "paste0")}. By default (as with
\code{paste}), this will have the seperator be a single space
(\code{" "}) between the pasted objects. This behavior can be
changed with the \code{infixit.paste_sep} option. E.g.,
\code{options(infixit.paste_sep = "|")}
}
\examples{
{

b <- "An additional sentence."

"This is a sentence. " \%+\% b
