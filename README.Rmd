>  Infix functions get their name from the fact the function name comes inbetween its arguments, and hence have two arguments.

`{infixit}` is an R package that looks to extend the available infix operators in R with some that are helpful for programming and data manipulation tasks. Additionally, the specific behaviors of many of these operators are (to an extent) customizable using some of the package's `options()`.

It can be downloaded through the following:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("prlitics/infixit")
```

There are currently 3 infix functions packaged with `{infixit}`:

1. `%+%`: Providing string concatenation. 
2. `%nin%`: Providing the inverse of the `%in%` function (e.g., whether an element of $X$ _is **not**_ in $Y$).
3. `%btwn%`: Lets users determine if numeric elements of $X$ are **b**e**tw**ee**n** values $Y_1$ and $Y_2$. 


While there are ways to achieve the end-behaviors of these functions, the intent is to do so in a way that maximizes the ease of coders and the readability of the code they produce.




## Code Examples

### `%+%` (String Concatenation)

Use `%+%` to paste strings together without wrapping it within `paste0` or `paste`.

```{r concat}
a <- "Hello "
b <- "world!"
c <- " Let's do our best!"

a %+% b %+% c

```

However, it some instances, users might apprciate having a bit of extra padding to their strings, such as pasting full sentences together. By default `%+%` wraps around `paste0`, but`infixit` has the option for users to specify `paste` as the concatenation method, which will add a space between pasted objects.

```{r concat2}
options(infixit.paste = "paste") #default is paste0

a <- "Hello" #Notice no trailing space here to accommodate "world"
b <- "world!"
c <- "Let's do our best!" #No leading space here.

a %+% b %+% c

```


### `%nin%` (Not in)

Normally, you can use `%in%` to check if your left-hand-side element is **in** the set of elments on the right hand side.

```{r in}
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "kiwi", "pears")

"apple" %in% fruits

"tomato" %in% fruits

```


Use `%nin%` when you want to select features that are **n**ot **in** a set of values. 

```{r nin}
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "kiwi", "pears")

"apple" %nin% fruits

"tomato" %nin% fruits

```

`%nin` can be useful when you're filtering data. Let's say, for example, that you are working with the `penguins` data from the [`{palmerpenguins}`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package. You are only interested in penguins that are not from either "Torgersen" nor "Biscoe" islands.

```{r nin_filter}

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(palmerpenguins))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

penguins %>%
  filter(island %nin% c("Torgersen", "Biscoe")) %>%
  count(island)



```

Now the data are only limited to "Dream" island. Though a relatively simple example, this functionality can be especially useful if you have a long list of things that a value could be `%in%`. 

### `%btwn%` (Whether a numeric value is between two others)

Use `%btwn%` to determine whether values on the left-hand-side are within the bounds defined on the right-hand-side. `%btwn%` can accomodate both integer and double types; basically anything that can be coerced to a numeric value.

```{r btwn}

c(1,2,3.5,4.2,5,6) %btwn% c(2,4)


```
By default, the bounds on the right-hand-side are considered **_inclusive_**, meaning that if a left-hand-side value matches one of the two bounds, it will return as `TRUE`. In mathematics, inclusivity can be denoted with square brackets "[" or "]". It is possible to change the behavior such that the values are **exclusive**, meaning that an exact match for the specified boundary value will return as `FALSE`.

The "infixit.btwn" option that is loaded with the package allows users to define whether the lower boundary is (in/ex)clusive and/or whether the upper boundary is (in/ex)clusive.


```{r btwn_opts}

options(infixit.btwn = c("[","]")) #inclusive left and right, default
c(1,2,3,4,5) %btwn% c(2,4)


options(infixit.btwn = c("[",")")) #inclusive left, exclusive right
c(1,2,3,4,5) %btwn% c(2,4)

options(infixit.btwn = c("(","]")) #exclusive left, inclusive right
c(1,2,3,4,5) %btwn% c(2,4)


options(infixit.btwn = c("(",")")) #exclusive left and right
c(1,2,3,4,5) %btwn% c(2,4)


```

`%btwn%` can be especially helpful in the context of `{dplyr}`'s `case_when` function. Let's imagine that we are trying to group penguins by body mass (chunk 'em by chonk, one might say). We want to put them into quartiles; 0-24.99% of the sample, 25-49.99% of the sample, 50-74.99% of the sample, and 75% to the sample max. We can discover these values using the `quantile` function.

```{r penguin_mass}

quantile(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)

```


A normal way to do this with `case_when` would be:

```{r case_standard}

penguins %>%
  mutate(chonk_level = case_when(
    
    body_mass_g < 3550 ~ 1,
    body_mass_g >= 3550 & body_mass_g < 4050 ~ 2,
    body_mass_g >= 4050 & body_mass_g < 4750 ~ 3,
    body_mass_g >= 4750 ~ 4
    
  )) %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, chonk_level) %>%
  head()

```


With `%btwn%`:

```{r case_btwn}

options(infixit.btwn = c("[",")"))

penguins %>%
  mutate(chonk_level = case_when(
    
    body_mass_g < 3550 ~ 1,
    body_mass_g %btwn% c(3550, 4050) ~ 2,
    body_mass_g %btwn% c(4050, 4750) ~ 3,
    body_mass_g >= 4750 ~ 4
    
  )) %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, chonk_level) %>%
  head()

```
