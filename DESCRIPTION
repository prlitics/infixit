Description: Infix functions in R are those that comes between its
  arguments such as `%in%`, `+`, and `*`. These are useful in R 
  programmin when manipulating data, performing logical operations, 
  and making new functions. 'infixit' extends the infix functions 
  found in 'R' to simplify frequent tasks, such as finding elements
  that are NOT in a set, in-line text concatenation, and identifying
  if a number lies between two others.
