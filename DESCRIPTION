Description: Infix functions in R are those that comes between its
  arguments such as %in%, +, and *. These are useful in R 
  programming when manipulating data, performing logical operations, 
  and making new functions. 'infixit' extends the infix functions 
  found in 'R' to simplify frequent tasks, such as finding elements
  that are NOT in a set, in-line text concatenation, augmented assignment
  operations, and identifying if a number or date lies between two others.
